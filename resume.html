<h4>PROJECT</h4>
<h4>Machine Learning Model to Classify Indian Taxi System in Tourism Industry</h4>
<p>India is now becoming a tourism hotspot for tourist. To support the growing tourism industry,the taxi services play a major role and also it plays an important role in urban transportation.In view of the popularity of Taxi services, we have analyzed the sentiment of the taxi 
industry by taking the reviews of the customer on different taxi service providers. In this research, we addressed text sentiment analysis of taxi reviews, posted by customers on online 
review sites. All the reviews are based on Indian review sites only. We have compared many machine learning techniques with the dataset. To determine the sentiments of text reviews, machine learning techniques are used, which explore the feeling of a customer and also give 
the in-hand idea of the taxi services and its amenities. The study presents that among all the common machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machine (SVM) performs better than other algorithms. Considering different evaluation parameters like Accuracy, F1- Score, and Recall value, SVM gives the best result with 89%, 82%, and 86% respectively. </p>
